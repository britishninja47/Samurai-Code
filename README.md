My first TWO-PLAYER fighting game for the PC/Mac was from Chris Courses (Youtuber) who showed me how to create this amazing 2 player fighting game. Since this is my first game, I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, so grab a friend and fight till the end! Thanks to LuizMelo on Itch for the sprites I used for this game and Ansimuz for the impressive futuristic 8-bit background!! 
(BUGZ WILL BE FIXED SOON WITH MORE TO COME)

- 2 Characters to play as Zen or D-Knight 
- 1 attack button (more coming soon)
